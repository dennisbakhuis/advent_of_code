# Day 13: Point of incidence
Finally we found a spring that could shoot us to Lava Island. Arriving at
the floating island you immediately see the problem: no lava. There are
however many many mirrors, and most of them seem to be aligned to some
average direction. Some have fallen down, so we need to locate the missing
mirrorsl

## Puzzle 1 - number of reflection points
We need to find the reflection line, this could be horizontal or vertical.

## Puzzle 2 - smudges on the mirror
This time we need to find a second reflection line which was hidden by a
smudge.
