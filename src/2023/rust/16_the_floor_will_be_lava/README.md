# Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava
As we ventured deeper into the Lava Production Facility, led by the reindeer,
the surroundings subtly transformed from steel walls to a vast, natural cave.
Navigating through this massive cavern, we stumbled upon the source of the beam
of light we'd been tracking. It was emerging from the cavern wall, directing
its full force onto a peculiar contraption across the room. This device, a
flat, two-dimensional grid adorned with mirrors and splitters, meticulously
converted the beam's light into heat, melting the surrounding rock. It was a
fascinating and unexpected discovery at what felt like the very heart of the
mountain.

## Puzzle 1 - laser beams through a maze
First we have to calculate how much is energized using a particular pattern of
mirrors and a laser entering from the top left corner. There are also splitters
that split the beam into two beams. Quite a nifty puzzle.

## Puzzle 2 - find the best entry point for maximum energy
Now we can enter from any side on any cell and we have to try them all to find
the maximum energy. This is a bit more challenging, as there are situations
where the beam will get stuck in a loop and we have to detect that.

Not too hard, and quite fun.
